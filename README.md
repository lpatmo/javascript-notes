##Titles
###Professional Javascript for Web Developers (3rd edition, 2012) by Nicholas Zakas
URL: http://www.amazon.com/Professional-JavaScript-Developers-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/1118026691/
Status/Review: Read a few chapters; need to go back and review (and continue taking notes).

###Codecademy's Javascript Tracks
URL: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript
Status/Review: Complete. Good introduction for the beginner, and I got a lot of practice writing functions and loops. Codecademy's key feature is repetition; you get a *lot* of practice writing stuff out. *grin*

###Javascript: The Definitive Guide (6th edition, May 2011) by David Flanagan
URL: http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-David-Flanagan/dp/0596000480
Status/Review: Started reading; need to go back and review. 

###Eloquent Javascript: A Modern Introduction to Programming (2007) by Marijn Haverbeke
URL: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
Status/Review: Finished reading! I plan to revisit this, though, since I barely took any notes the first time through. 

###Javascript: The Good Parts by Doug Crockford
URL: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do
Status/Review: This was the book I started a year ago but never finished. I'll be reviewing it again and typing up notes this time. 

###Codeschool.com's Try jQuery
URL: http://try.jquery.com/
Status/Review: Codeschool's free Intro to jQuery tutorial is great! I really like this company's emphasis on taking the material and applying it in a live, interactive way via the exercise sets. Perhaps I found it easier to complete this specific tutorial since I'd already started reading Javascript & jQuery: The Missing Manual when I went through the exercises. 

###Codecademy's jQuery Track
URL: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery
Status/Review: Finished this pretty quickly. It offers good typing practice and a neat introduction to the jQuery UI library (.draggable() wins), but it's not as comprehensive as Codecademy's javascript track. 

###Javascript & jQuery: The Missing Manual, Second Edition (2011) by David Sawyer McFarland
URL: http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-jQuery-The-Missing-Manual/dp/1449399029
Status/Review: This was my first book on jQuery. The javascript section can be read through pretty quickly, and I remember -- as a beginner -- being really excited after reading the bulk of the jQuery section because it was written in a such an understandable way. I wasn't such a huge fan of some of the examples written in the latter parts of the book, though -- since the author emphasized a few specific jQuery plugins rather than talk about non-plugin solutions. But the majority of the book was great!

###jQuery Cookbook by Cody Lindley (2010)
URL: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159788.do
Status/Review: I'm a pretty big fan of books written in the question/answer format ("The CSS3 Anthology" by Rachel Andrew is another example of a book written this way), but this cookbook definitely isn't for the beginner. So far I've only skimmed through it, and already I've been introduced to a lot of new methods that I haven't yet started to use. Cookbook's pretty comprehensive, and wasn't quite as fun to skim through as the CSS3 Anthology, but I expect to start referencing it a lot more in the near future.
